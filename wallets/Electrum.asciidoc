Electrum is a light weight Bitcoin wallet for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The main features of Electrum are support for hardware wallets TREZOR and HW1, secure cold storage using an offline computer, and decentralized verification using SPV.

## Security

Electrum can function as a hot wallet or cold storage. For both wallet types, a 12 word seed is generated which allows the user to backup and restore the entire wallet and its keys.

For cold storage, users generate the seed on a secure offline computer and write it down on a piece of paper. A master public key is created from the seed and imported into a seperate Electrum install on the user’s everyday computer. The user may now view the wallet balance, accept payments, and create new addresses on a hot computer without the risk of funds being stolen. All transactions must be signed by the offline computer.

All Electrum private keys are encrypted and never leave the user’s computer. Regular Electrum wallet not using an offline computer should be treated as a hot wallet, as it’s still possible to have malware steal funds.

Although Electrum relies on third-party servers, the worst attack they can do is fake transaction data. The servers have no way of accessing funds.

Electrum is an HD wallet and uses change addresses by default.

## Privacy

Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin client, and uses servers created by users to get transaction and balance information. A server has no way of knowing a user’s actual identity, but does the user’s IP address, wallet addresses, and balance.

Tor can be used to prevent the server from knowing your IP address, but cannot prevent the server from knowing each user’s balance and addresses.

Some servers claim to not log or store information, but it is impossible to know for sure without setting up an Electrum server.
