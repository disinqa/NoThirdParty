Hive is an elegant, HD Bitcoin wallet available on the web, iPhone, and Android. It aims to be ‘human-friendly’, allows the user to control private keys, and offers basic send and receive features. Hive also supports Litecoin.

A 12-word seed is generated upon wallet creation on the web, or iPhone/Android app. The seed creates the wallet and its addresses. The seed can be imported to Hive’s web wallet if the original wallet was made on Android/iOS, and vice-versa.

Hive offers a feature called ‘Waggle’, which, using your geo-location, scans for other Hive users within 1 kilometer of your location. A list is then presented of any users found, and payments can be sent by clicking on a name.

## Security

A 12-word seed is generated on account creation. This seed is an account backup; all addresses and funds can be restored with it.

A pin must be made on wallet creation, and is required upon opening the app or logging in.

A mobile wallet is only as secure as the device it’s running on. Hive encrypts all data and keys. An unrooted (Android)/non-jailbroken (iOS) device should be used.

## Privacy

As an HD wallet, Hive generates a new address for every transaction and does not re-use addresses. Using a new address for each transaction helps prevent spying on your payments and funds.
