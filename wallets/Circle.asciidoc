Circle is a digital money company focused on making money “instant, secure, and free”. Its homepage only briefly mentions Bitcoin, and its wallet doesn’t do much more than receiving and spending.

## Security

Circle is a web/hot wallet, and should not be used to store large amounts of bitcoin. With full control over your account, Circle can freeze your funds at any time.

Circle offers insurance on the bitcoin it holds for its customers. However, a loss is only covered if something goes wrong on Circle’s end. If an account is hacked, a user’s bitcoins are gone and Circle cannot help.

Circle requires its users to setup two-factor authentication.

## Privacy

Circle requires your name, phone number, email, and a number of other personal details when setting up a wallet. Because Circle has buy/sell features, it must also follow all KYC laws. It can also monitor your IP address.

Circle is not recommended to users who value their privacy.
