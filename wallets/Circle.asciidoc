Circle is a digital money company focused on making money “instant, secure, and free”. Its homepage only briefly mentions Bitcoin, and its wallet doesn’t do much more than receiving and spending.

Accounts may be accessed on Circle’s website and iPhone or Android app. Both apps including the buying/selling features and basic sending and receiving of payments.

## Security

As a web/hot wallet, Circle should not be used to store large amounts of bitcoin. With full control over all accounts and private keys, your funds may be frozen at any time.

Although all bitcoin is insured, a loss is only covered if something goes wrong on Circle’s end. If your account is hacked, the bitcoins are gone.

Two-factor authentication is required.

## Privacy

Your name, phone number, email, and a number of other personal details are required. You must trust Circle’s servers to verify transaction data. Circle knows your addresses and balances at all times and can connect this with your identity. Because of buy/sell features, it must also follow all KYC laws.

Each payment request uses a new address, which helps prevent other users from connecting Bitcoin addresses together.
