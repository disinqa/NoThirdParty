Circle is a digital money company focused on making money “instant, secure, and free”. Its homepage only briefly mentions Bitcoin, and its wallet doesn’t do much more than receiving and spending.

## Security

Circle is a web/hot wallet, and should not be used to store large amounts of bitcoin. With full control over all accounts and private keys, Circle can freeze funds at any time.

Although Circle insures all of the bitcoin it holds for its customers, a loss is only covered if something goes wrong on Circle’s end. If an account is hacked, a user’s bitcoins are gone and Circle cannot help.

Circle requires its users to setup two-factor authentication.

## Privacy

Circle requires the user’s name, phone number, email, and a number of other personal details when setting up a wallet. Users must trust Circle’s servers to verify transaction data. Circle knows all users’ addresses and balances at all times. Because Circle has buy/sell features, it must also follow all KYC laws.

Each payment request uses a new address, which helps prevent other users from connecting Bitcoin addresses together.
