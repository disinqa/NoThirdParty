Mycelium, founded in 2008, is a Bitcoin company with 35 employees located in Europe, Asia, and America. Mycelium offers mobile wallets for iPhone and Android. All of Mycelium’s applications are open source.

Mycelium is a good option for new users, with basic features like watch-only addresses, cold storage spending, and HD accounts. Advanced options include TREZOR support, xpub/xpriv key exports, and decrypting BIP38 keys.

## Security

A mobile wallet is only as secure as the device it’s running on. Mycelium encrypts all your data and keys. An unrooted (Android)/non-jailbroken (iOS) device should be used.

Users can create a backup by writing down the 12 word seed provided in the app. If the phone is reset or lost, all funds can be recovered by re-entering the seed.

## Privacy

Both the iOS and Android apps connect directly to the Mycelium’s servers. Directly connecting to Mycelium’s servers allows for instant connection to the Bitcoin network, but reduces the privacy of users.

Mycelium’s servers can view your IP address and the balance of your wallet. The company website claims to not log IP information, however there is no way to be sure. Orbot/Tor can be used to hide your IP address from Mycelium.

As an HD wallet, Mycelium generates a new address for every transaction and does not re-use addresses. Using a new address for each transaction helps prevent spying on your payments and funds.

The Mycelium developers recognized that users value their privacy, and plan to implement CoinJoin in future updates.
