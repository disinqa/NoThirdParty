Bitcoin Wallet, or “Schildbach Wallet”, was the first mobile Bitcoin wallet and has over 500,000 downloads in the Google Play Store.

## Security

A mobile wallet is only as secure as the device it’s running on. Bitcoin Wallet encrypts all data and keys. An unrooted Android device should be used.

A file containing the wallet’s private keys are encrypted and stored on your phone. The file should be backed up to another location in case your phone is lost or reset.

Bitcoin Wallet is more secure than most mobile Bitcoin wallets, because it connects directly to the Bitcoin network with SPV. Most other wallets connect to centralized servers for transaction information.

## Privacy

Bitcoin Wallet is not an HD wallet. However, it still generates a new address for each transaction making it more difficult for spying or tracking your payments.

Bitcoin Wallet connects directly to the Bitcoin network and peers can see your phone’s IP address.
