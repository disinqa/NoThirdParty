Bitcoin wallets are the gateway to Satoshi's dream of a peer-to-peer economy with no trusted third parties. At No Third Party, we make choosing and learning about Bitcoin wallets simple. 

New Bitcoin users face the same question: which wallet should I use? Our wallet overviews–which are strictly facts and unbiased–make it easy to understand each Bitcoin wallet’s features, how it secures funds, and its level of privacy. 

No Third Party was founded by [Jordan Tuwiner](http://jordantuwiner.com) in January 2015.
