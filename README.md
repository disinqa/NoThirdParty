Bitcoin wallets are the gateway to Satoshi Nakamoto’s dream of a peer-to-peer economy. At No Third Party, learning about Bitcoin wallets is simple.

New Bitcoin users face the same question: which wallet should I use? Our wallet overviews–which are strictly facts and unbiased–make it easy to understand each Bitcoin wallet’s features, how it secures funds, and its level of privacy.
